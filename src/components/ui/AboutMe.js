                Hi there! üëãüèº
                <br />
                I‚Äôm Hersh, a Software Engineer based in London with a passion
                for everything tech. After graduating from the University of
                Warwick in Computer Systems Engineering, I decided to take a
                unique path by working as the National President of KCSOC for a
                year. I‚Äôm now looking to work for an exciting, vibrant
                technology company where I can channel my leadership, creativity
                and technical skills that I have developed over the years.
                <br />
                <br />I created this website to showcase my experience, skills
                and various technical projects. If you‚Äôd like to get in touch
